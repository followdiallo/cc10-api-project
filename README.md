# About the Data

A lot of the data comes from the [RuPaul-Predict-A-Looza Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sotvl3o7J_ckKUg5sRiZTqNQn3hPqhepBSeOpMTK15Q/edit#gid=1613421713).

This data does not include data from All Stars seasons.
Queens who have appeared in multiple seasons (Shangela Laquifa Wadley, Cynthia Lee Fontaine, Eureka, and Vanessa Vanjie Mateo) are included twice, with a different object for each season.

**id**: Unique id for each queen. Werkroom entrance in chronological order (1 is Shannel; 144 is Soju).

**name**: NAME

**season**: SEASON

**ranking**: A queen's placement in her season. Queens with a ranking of 1 won their season.

**congeniality**: Boolean indicating whether or not the queen won Miss Congeniality.

**snatch_game**: Boolean indicating whether or not the queen won Snatch Game.

**first_win**: Boolean indicating whether or not the queen won the first challenge of her season.

**entrance**: The order in which the queen entered the werkroom on her season. (Queens with entrance 1 were the first to enter, queens with entrance 2 were the second to enter, etc.)

**wins**: The number of maxi challenges the queen won during her season. Note that this number includes neither mini challenges nor All Stars challenges.
